Build high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser. Animate CSS, SVG, canvas, React, Vue, WebGL, colors, strings, motion paths, generic objects...anything JavaScript can touch! GSAP's <a href=\"https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger\">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin lets you create jaw-dropping scroll-based animations with minimal code. No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 10 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations **just work**. At its core, GSAP is a high-speed property manipulator, updating values over time with extreme accuracy. It's up to 20x faster than jQuery! See https://greensock.com/why-gsap/ for what makes GSAP so special.\n\n### What is GSAP? (video)\n\n[![What is GSAP?](http://greensock.com/_img/github/thumb-what-is-gsap-small.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYuau0NeR1U)\n\n\nGSAP is completely flexible; sprinkle it wherever you want. **Zero dependencies.**\n\nThere are many optional <a href=\"https://greensock.com/gsap-plugins/\">plugins</a> and <a href=\"https://greensock.com/ease-visualizer/\">easing</a> functions for achieving advanced effects easily like <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger\">scrolling</a>, <a href=\"https://greensock.com/morphsvg\">morphing</a>, or animating along a <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin\">motion path</a>. \n\n## Docs &amp; Installation\nView the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs\">full documentation here</a>, including an <a href=\"https://greensock.com/install\">installation guide</a> with videos.\n\n### CDN\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.8.0/gsap.min.js\"></script>\n```\nClick the green \"Get GSAP Now\" button at <a href=\"https://greensock.com/?download=GSAP-JS\">greensock.com</a> for more options and installation instructions, including CDN URLs for various plugins. \n\n**Every major ad network excludes GSAP from file size calculations** and most have it on their own CDNs, so contact them for the appropriate URL(s). \n\n### NPM\nSee the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation#npm\">guide to using GSAP via NPM here</a>.\n\n```javascript\nnpm install gsap\n```\nThe default (main) file is **gsap.js** which includes most of the eases as well as the core plugins like CSSPlugin, AttrPlugin, SnapPlugin, ModifiersPlugin, and all of the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods\">utility methods</a> like interpolate(), mapRange(), etc. \n```javascript\n// typical import\nimport gsap from \"gsap\";\n\n// or get other plugins:\nimport ScrollTrigger from \"gsap/ScrollTrigger\";\nimport Draggable from \"gsap/Draggable\";\n\n// or all tools are exported from the \"all\" file (excluding bonus plugins):\nimport { gsap, ScrollTrigger, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin } from \"gsap/all\";\n\n// don't forget to register plugins\ngsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger, Draggable, MotionPathPlugin); \n```\nThe NPM files are ES modules, but there's also a /dist/ directory with <a href=\"https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/\">UMD</a> files for extra compatibility.\n\nDownload <a href=\"https://greensock.com/club/\">Club GreenSock</a> members-only plugins from your GreenSock.com account and then include them in your own JS payload.
